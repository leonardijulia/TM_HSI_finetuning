# 🛰️ Fine-Tuning TerraMind
This repository contains the experimental configurations and hyperparameter setups used to adapt the TerraMind Geospatial Foundation Model (GFM) for Hyperspectral Data Analysis.

### 🔬 Research Goal
GFMs are typically trained on RGB or Multispectral Sentinel-2 data. This project investigates strategies to fine-tune these pre-trained backbones for Hyperspectral inputs, aiming to leverage the rich spectral resolution for tasks like:

✅ Crop classification

✅ Soil property estimation

✅ Greenhouse Gas detection *(upcoming)*

TBC...
